Once upon a time, Tim the haircutter was dropped in the the middle of Madison, Wisconsin right outside the capitol. 
It was the middle of winter, so Tim was very cold. He went off towards State Street to search for a place to get a hot meal.

He decided to go to Ian's Pizza because its the best. He got a slice about the size of a kite of macaroni pizza and then proceeded to keep walking down State Street.
